## What's Changed

* V4 - Use new .NET CDN URLs and update to latest install scripts by @heavymachinery in https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/pull/566

Some .NET binaries and installers currently hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains ending in .azureedge.net will move to new domains as the provider, edg.io, will [soon cease operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq). There may be downtime or unavailability of .azureedge.net domains in the future as the .NET team is required to [migrate to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and set of domains moving forward.

If your workflows are pinned to specific SHAs or minor tags, please upgrade to a major release tag to avoid service disruptions. Edgio has confirmed their services will be operational until [at least January 15, 2025](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq).

## What's Changed

In the scope of this release, the version of the Node.js runtime was updated to 20. The majority of dependencies were updated to the latest versions. From now on, the code for the setup-dotnet will run on Node.js 20 instead of Node.js 16.

**Breaking changes**

- Update Node.js runtime to version 20 by @harithavattikuti in #484
- Sequential version install fix by @nikolai-laevskii in https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/pull/433
In setup-dotnet@v3, the dotnet executable was overwritten during each action run, sometimes leading to failures if the executable was still in use. This issue was resolved in setup-dotnet@v4 by introducing an additional install-script run that installs the LTS version of the dotnet executable and utilizes it for all subsequent dotnet installations. The actual download is performed only once per workflow by the initial install-script run. To use older versions, utilize global.json. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet?tab=readme-ov-file#usage).

**Non-breaking changes**

* Refactor installer by @nikolai-laevskii in https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/pull/432
* Allow json comments by @nikolai-laevskii in https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/pull/431
* Update fast-xml-parser and dotnet installer scripts by @IvanZosimov in https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/pull/437
* Update dependencies by @IvanZosimov in https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/pull/440

## What's Changed

### Breaking Changes
* Enhance caching in setup-node with automatic package manager detection by @priya-kinthali in https://github.com/actions/setup-node/pull/1348

This update, introduces automatic caching when a valid `packageManager` field is present in your `package.json`. This aims to improve workflow performance and make dependency management more seamless. 
To disable this automatic caching, set `package-manager-cache: false`
```yaml
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v5
- uses: actions/setup-node@v5
  with:
    package-manager-cache: false
```
* Upgrade action to use node24 by @salmanmkc in https://github.com/actions/setup-node/pull/1325

Make sure your runner is on version v2.327.1 or later to ensure compatibility with this release. [See Release Notes](https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/tag/v2.327.1)

## Notice: Breaking Changes :warning:

We will no longer include hidden files and folders by default in the `upload-artifact` action of this version. This reduces the risk that credentials are accidentally uploaded into artifacts. Customers who need to continue to upload these files can use a new option, `include-hidden-files`, to continue to do so.

See ["Notice of upcoming deprecations and breaking changes in GitHub Actions runners"](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-08-19-notice-of-upcoming-deprecations-and-breaking-changes-in-github-actions-runners/) changelog and [this issue](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/602) for more details.

## What's Changed

The release of upload-artifact@v4 and download-artifact@v4 are major changes to the backend architecture of Artifacts. They have numerous performance and behavioral improvements.

ℹ️ However, this is a major update that includes breaking changes. Artifacts created with versions v3 and below are not compatible with the v4 actions.

## Notice: Breaking Changes :warning:

We will no longer include hidden files and folders by default in the `upload-artifact` action of this version. This reduces the risk that credentials are accidentally uploaded into artifacts. Customers who need to continue to upload these files can use a new option, `include-hidden-files`, to continue to do so.

See ["Notice of upcoming deprecations and breaking changes in GitHub Actions runners"](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-08-19-notice-of-upcoming-deprecations-and-breaking-changes-in-github-actions-runners/) changelog and [this issue](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/602) for more details.

## What's Changed
* Update README.md by @nebuk89 in https://github.com/actions/download-artifact/pull/407
* BREAKING fix: inconsistent path behavior for single artifact downloads by ID by @GrantBirki in https://github.com/actions/download-artifact/pull/416

## v5.0.0

### 🚨 Breaking Change

This release fixes an inconsistency in path behavior for single artifact downloads by ID. **If you're downloading single artifacts by ID, the output path may change.**

#### What Changed

Previously, **single artifact downloads** behaved differently depending on how you specified the artifact:

- **By name**: `name: my-artifact` → extracted to `path/` (direct)
- **By ID**: `artifact-ids: 12345` → extracted to `path/my-artifact/` (nested)

Now both methods are consistent:

- **By name**: `name: my-artifact` → extracted to `path/` (unchanged)
- **By ID**: `artifact-ids: 12345` → extracted to `path/` (fixed - now direct)

#### Migration Guide

##### ✅ No Action Needed If:

- You download artifacts by **name**
- You download **multiple** artifacts by ID
- You already use `merge-multiple: true` as a workaround

##### ⚠️ Action Required If:

You download **single artifacts by ID** and your workflows expect the nested directory structure.

**Before v5 (nested structure):**

```yaml
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
  with:
    artifact-ids: 12345
    path: dist
# Files were in: dist/my-artifact/
```

> Where `my-artifact` is the name of the artifact you previously uploaded

**To maintain old behavior (if needed):**

```yaml
- uses: actions/download-artifact@v5
  with:
    artifact-ids: 12345
    path: dist/my-artifact  # Explicitly specify the nested path
```

## What's Changed

The release of upload-artifact@v4 and download-artifact@v4 are major changes to the backend architecture of Artifacts. They have numerous performance and behavioral improvements.

ℹ️ However, this is a major update that includes breaking changes. Artifacts created with versions v3 and below are not compatible with the v4 actions. Uploads and downloads _must_ use the same major actions versions. There are also key differences from previous versions that may require updates to your workflows.

For more information, please see:
1. The [changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-12-14-github-actions-artifacts-v4-is-now-generally-available/) post.
2. The [README](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact/blob/main/README.md).
3. The [migration documentation](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/blob/main/docs/MIGRATION.md).
4. As well as the underlying npm package, [@actions/artifact](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/artifact) documentation.

## Breaking Changes
1. Action is now stateful: If the action ends because of [operations-per-run](https://github.com/actions/stale#operations-per-run) then the next run will start from the first unprocessed issue skipping the issues processed during the previous run(s). The state is reset when all the issues are processed. This should be considered for scheduling workflow runs.
2. Version 9 of this action updated the runtime to Node.js 20. All scripts are now run with Node.js 20 instead of Node.js 16 and are affected by any breaking changes between Node.js 16 and 20.

## What Else Changed
1. Performance optimization that removes unnecessary API calls by @dsame [#1033](https://github.com/actions/stale/pull/1033/) fixes [#792](https://github.com/actions/stale/issues/792)
2. Logs displaying current github API rate limit by @dsame [#1032](https://github.com/actions/stale/pull/1032) addresses [#1029](https://github.com/actions/stale/issues/1029)

For more information, please read the [action documentation](https://github.com/actions/stale#readme) and its [section about statefulness](https://github.com/actions/stale#statefulness)
